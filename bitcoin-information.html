          <h1>Bitcoin Information &amp; Resources</h1>
          <p>Bitcoin is a revolutionary system that is quite complex and has a steep learning curve. The goal of this site is to provide an index of curated high quality educational resources and information about Bitcoin to make it easier to educate yourself. Make sure you have a decent grasp of the system before you store a significant amount of value in it.</p>
          <p>Note that this list is open source; please <a href="https://github.com/jlopp/lopp.net/tree/master/bitcoin-information">suggest changes on Github</a>!</p>

          <h2 id="getting_started"><a href="bitcoin-information/getting-started.html">Getting Started&#10147;</a></h2>
          <p>Why is Bitcoin a unique monetary system? How does it work? Why should you care?</p>
          <h2 id="setting_up_wallet"><a href="bitcoin-information/recommended-wallets.html">Setting up a Wallet&#10147;</a></h2>
          <p>There are dozens of wallets to choose from when it comes to securing your private keys. Hardware, software, metal, paper, each with their own trade-offs. Remember: if you aren't holding your own private keys, you don't actually own bitcoin - you just own an IOU for BTC!</p>
          <h2 id="running_node"><a href="bitcoin-information/full-node.html">Running a Node&#10147;</a></h2>
          <p>While managing your own keys ensures that you can't lose your money due to the negligence or maliciousness of a custodian, running a full node ensures that you can't be tricked into accepting invalid bitcoin payments. Running and using your own node gives you the strongest security model Bitcoin has to offer.</p>
          <h2 id="history"><a href="bitcoin-information/history.html">The History of Bitcoin&#10147;</a></h2>
          <p>Bitcoin didn't simply appear out of thin air - it was built upon decades of work and came after many failed digital currency projects. Understanding how we got here will help you understand where we're going.</p>
          <h2 id="news"><a href="bitcoin-information/news.html">News Sites&#10147;</a></h2>
          <p>It can be tricky to find objective reporting in the crypto space, as many "news" sites are pay-to-play or are owned by people with vested interests in certain projects. These sites tend to feature high quality content and are not known for publishing paid press releases as news.</p>
          <h2 id="forums"><a href="bitcoin-information/discussion-forums.html">Discussion Forums&#10147;</a></h2>
          <p>Because Bitcoin is an open collaborative project, discussing current events and ideas for improving the ecosystem are crucial to its evolution.</p>
          <h2 id="stats"><a href="bitcoin-information/statistics-metrics.html">Network Statistics&#10147;</a></h2>
          <p>There are a plethora of metrics that can be observed about the system in order to gauge its adoption and use.</p>
          <h2 id="tx_fee_estimates"><a href="bitcoin-information/fee-estimates.html">Transaction Fee Estimates&#10147;</a></h2>
          <p>Transactions get prioritized for confirmation by miners based upon which ones are offering the highest processing fees. Because the demand for transactions tends to fluctuate, it can be tricky to know what an appropriate fee is at the moment. A variety of fee estimation services have been developed to help users navigate the fee market.</p>
          <h2 id="explorers"><a href="bitcoin-information/block-explorers.html">Block Explorers&#10147;</a></h2>
          <p>Explorers provide us with a view of the entire blockchain, enabling us to see the aggregate flow of money and also letting you drill down into specific transactions.</p>
          <h2 id="visualizations"><a href="bitcoin-information/visualizations.html">Visualizations&#10147;</a></h2>
          <p>Due to the abundance of data available about the activity on the blockchain, it can be helpful to simplify aspects into visual representations of the data.</p>
          <h2 id="mining"><a href="bitcoin-information/mining.html">Mining&#10147;</a></h2>
          <p>Mining is an important aspect of Bitcoin's security - timestamping batches of transactions and making it expensive to reverse transactions that have been confirmed. These days the time, skills, and capital investment required to mine profitably is out of reach for most hobbyists.</p>
          <h2 id="data_anchoring"><a href="bitcoin-information/data-anchor.html">Data Anchoring&#10147;</a></h2>
          <p>Bitcoin's blockchain can be used for more than just transfers of BTC between peers. It can also be used to create an immutable timestamped record of small amounts of data, which enables other protocols and applications to make use of Bitcoin's security properties.</p>
          <h2 id="technical_resources"><a href="bitcoin-information/technical-resources.html">Deep Dive Technical Resources&#10147;</a></h2>
          <p>If you're a developer who wants to really understand how Bitcoin works under the hood, this documentation will get you up to speed.</p>
          <h2 id="dev_tools"><a href="bitcoin-information/developer-tools.html">Developer Tools&#10147;</a></h2>
          <p>There are a ton of open source tools available for developers to use in order to save a lot of time while building Bitcoin based applications. There's no need to re-invent the wheel!</p>
          <h2 id="security"><a href="bitcoin-information/security.html">Security&#10147;</a></h2>
          <p>Managing private keys securely in order to "be your own bank" can involve some complex processes if you want to protect against every possible threat. There's also a balance against making it so complex that you lose access to your own keys - keep it as simple as possible!</p>
          <h2 id="privacy"><a href="bitcoin-information/privacy.html">Privacy&#10147;</a></h2>
          <p>Bitcoin is not an anonymous cryptocurrency - there are many ways that you may unintentionally leak information that could be used to identify your activity on the network. Understanding the common risks can help you mitigate them with privacy preserving software and best practices.</p>

          <h2 id="advanced_trading"><a href="bitcoin-information/trading.html">Advanced Trading&#10147;</a></h2>
          <p>WARNING: a great way to lose your bitcoins is by playing the trading game as an amatuer! Just as you should not invest more into BTC than you can afford to lose, neither should you trade more BTC than you are willing to lose.</p>
          <h2 id="live_exchange_data"><a href="bitcoin-information/exchange-data.html">Exchange Rate Data&#10147;</a></h2>
