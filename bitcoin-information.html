          <h1>Bitcoin Information &amp; Resources</h1>
          <p>Bitcoin is a revolutionary system that is quite complex and has a steep learning curve. Below you'll find curated educational resources and information about Bitcoin. You could spend months sifting through them all. Make sure you have a decent grasp of the system before you store a significant amount of value in it! The same aspects of Bitcoin that make it so valuable also make it unforgiving to those who make mistakes.</p>
          <p>Note that this list is open source; please <a href="https://github.com/jlopp/lopp.net/tree/master/bitcoin-information">suggest changes on Github</a>!</p>

          <h2 id="getting_started"><a href="bitcoin-information/getting-started.html">Getting Started&#10147;</a></h2>
          <p>Why is Bitcoin a unique monetary system? How does it work? Why should you care?</p>
          <h2 id="setting_up_wallet"><a href="bitcoin-information/recommended-wallets.html">Setting up a Wallet&#10147;</a></h2>
          <p>There are dozens of wallets to choose from when it comes to securing your private keys. Hardware, software, metal, paper, each with their own trade-offs. Remember: if you aren't holding your own private keys, you don't actually own bitcoin - you only own an IOU for BTC!</p>
          <h2 id="running_node"><a href="bitcoin-information/full-node.html">Running a Node&#10147;</a></h2>
          <p>Holding your own keys ensures you can't lose money due to mistakes made by other people. Running a full node ensures no one can trick you into accepting invalid bitcoin payments. Running and using your own node gives you the strongest security model Bitcoin has to offer.</p>
          <h2 id="history"><a href="bitcoin-information/history.html">The History of Bitcoin&#10147;</a></h2>
          <p>Bitcoin didn't appear out of thin air - it is the result of decades of work. Many digital currency projects failed before Bitcoin succeeeded. Understanding how we got here will help you understand where we're going.</p>
          <h2 id="news"><a href="bitcoin-information/news.html">News Sites&#10147;</a></h2>
          <p>It is hard to find trustworthy reporting in the crypto space. Many "news" sites are pay-to-play or have incentives to favor certain projects. My recommended sites feature quality content and don't publish press releases as news.</p>
          <h2 id="forums"><a href="bitcoin-information/discussion-forums.html">Discussion Forums&#10147;</a></h2>
          <p>Bitcoin is an open collaborative project. As such, public discussion of current events and improvement proposals is crucial to its healthy evolution.</p>
          <h2 id="stats"><a href="bitcoin-information/statistics-metrics.html">Network Statistics&#10147;</a></h2>
          <p>There are a plethora of metrics available about different aspects of Bitcoin. They can help us track its adoption and use.</p>
          <h2 id="tx_fee_estimates"><a href="bitcoin-information/fee-estimates.html">Transaction Fee Estimates&#10147;</a></h2>
          <p>Miners maximize their profits by confirming transactions with the highest processing fees. Since the demand for transactions fluctuates it can be hard to know the appropriate fee. A variety of fee estimation services are available to help users navigate the fee market.</p>
          <h2 id="explorers"><a href="bitcoin-information/block-explorers.html">Block Explorers&#10147;</a></h2>
          <p>Bitcoin's blockchain is a public ledger of every transaction that has ever happened. Explorers provide us with a view of this history, enabling us to follow the flow of money. You can also drill down into specific addresses and transactions.</p>
          <h2 id="visualizations"><a href="bitcoin-information/visualizations.html">Visualizations&#10147;</a></h2>
          <p>Visual representations of the data on the blockchain can simplify analysis of trends. Plus, some of them are entertaining to watch!</p>
          <h2 id="mining"><a href="bitcoin-information/mining.html">Mining&#10147;</a></h2>
          <p>Mining is an important aspect of Bitcoin's security. Miners timestamp batches of transactions and make it expensive to roll back history. The time, skills, and investment required to mine profitably place it out of reach for most hobbyists. Stay away from cloud mining - it's often a scam, or more expensive than directly buying BTC!</p>
          <h2 id="data_anchoring"><a href="bitcoin-information/data-anchor.html">Data Anchoring&#10147;</a></h2>
          <p>Bitcoin's blockchain is useful for more than simple transfers of BTC between peers. It can also create immutable timestamped records of small amounts of data. This enables other protocols and applications to make use of Bitcoin's security properties.</p>
          <h2 id="technical_resources"><a href="bitcoin-information/technical-resources.html">Deep Dive Technical Resources&#10147;</a></h2>
          <p>If you want to understand low level details of the protocol, this documentation will get you up to speed. These resources are useful for developers who want to build Bitcoin-powered applications.</p>
          <h2 id="dev_tools"><a href="bitcoin-information/developer-tools.html">Developer Tools&#10147;</a></h2>
          <p>There are many open source tools available to help Bitcoin developers save time. There's no need to re-invent the wheel!</p>
          <h2 id="security"><a href="bitcoin-information/security.html">Security&#10147;</a></h2>
          <p>Managing private keys to "be your own bank" is no small task. It can involve complex processes if you want thorough protection against many threats. There's also a balance against making it so complex that you lose access to your own keys - keep it as simple as possible!</p>
          <h2 id="privacy"><a href="bitcoin-information/privacy.html">Privacy&#10147;</a></h2>
          <p>Bitcoin is not an anonymous cryptocurrency. There are many ways you might leak information that can be used to identify your activity on the network. Understanding the risks can help you mitigate them with software and best practices.</p>

          <p>It's not a great medium for nuanced discussion, but Twitter is a great way to track news and sentiment.</p>

          <p>If you want to use bitcoin you must first own some. You can exchange other money for BTC or you can earn it by selling goods &amp; services. A variety of platforms are available for both buying &amp; earning.</p>
          <h2 id="advanced_trading"><a href="bitcoin-information/trading.html">Advanced Trading&#10147;</a></h2>
          <p>WARNING: a great way to lose your bitcoins is by playing the trading game as an amateur! Don't invest more into bitcoin than you can afford to lose. Don't trade more bitcoin than you are willing to lose, either!</p>
          <h2 id="live_exchange_data"><a href="bitcoin-information/exchange-data.html">Exchange Rate Data&#10147;</a></h2>

          <p>Bitcoin's governance is often misunderstood because it's informal. It's further confusing to newcomers because it's inverted in comparison to traditional governance. No one can define Bitcoin's governance, but we can describe it from observation.</p>
          <h2 id="forks"><a href="bitcoin-information/forks.html">Forks&#10147;</a></h2>
          <p>Because no one controls Bitcoin, no one can stop people from creating modified versions of it. But it's hard to overcome Bitcoin's network effect and convince users to switch to a new protocol.</p>
